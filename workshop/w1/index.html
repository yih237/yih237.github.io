		<h2>Core 1 Interaction Review and Experience Questionnaire </h2>

		<h3>Fill out the following questionnaire to the best of your ability.</h3>

		<div>
			<p>1. Do you have an previous experience with coding? Which classes have you already taken that explored
				HTML/CSS or Javascript? </p>
			<div>
Only core 1 itneraction			</div>

			<p>2. If you have worked with code in the past, what parts of it made sense to you? Which parts were
				exciting?</p>
			<div>
I liked it, but it's kind of hard for me because my previous teacher didn't make things clear. HTML and CSS makes total sense, I just have some trouble with Javascript.			</div>

			<p>3. If you have worked with code in the past, which parts were the most confusing? What were the least
				interesting? </p>
			<div>
			Javascript was definitely most confusing. I had to miss an assignment because I have no idea how to change an external website's design using JS plugins.
			Everything made total sense when the teacher showed us but didn't when I tried to do it on my own.
			</div>

			<p>4. Do you have any anxieties around coding, or learning to code? Is there anything I can do to help
				alleviate those anxieties in this class? </p>
			<div>
				I am exited to be in your class! You are much more organized and experienced than my previous teacher, so I think
				that whenever we are anxious in coding I think you can help the anxieties by answering to our questions about
				things that we don't understand.
			</div>

			<p>5. In your own words, can you describe at a high level how the internet works? </p>
			<div>
				I think that basically it's just information uploading and downloading on personal computers and cellphones
				from routers to routers.
			</div>

			<p>6. What is the difference between a webpage, a website, and a web server?</p>

				A webpage is a single page, written under a url, while a website is the whole respiratory.<!-- answer goes here -->

			<p>9. Choosing a quote from an author you appreciate, use the Paragraph HTML element to display it, and
				use the inline Bold and Italic elements to add emphasis to certain parts of the quotation.</p>
			<div>
				<p>“When she does not find love, she may find <b>poetry</b>. Because she does not act, she observes, she feels, she records; a color, a smile awakens profound echoes within her; 
					her destiny is outside her, scattered in cities already built, on the faces of men already marked by life, she makes contact, she relishes with passion and yet in a manner more detached, 
					more free, than that of a young man. Being poorly integrated in the universe of humanity and hardly able to adapt herself therein, she, like the child, is able to see it <b>objectively</b>; 
					instead of being interested solely in her grasp on things, she looks for their significance; she catches their special outlines, their unexpected metamorphoses. 
					She rarely feels a bold creativeness, and usually she lacks the technique of self-expression; but in her conversation, her letters, her literary essays, her sketches, 
					she manifests an <i>original</i> sensitivity. The young girl throws herself into things with ardor, because she is not yet deprived of her <i>transcendence</i>; and the fact that she accomplishes nothing,
					that she is nothing, will make her impulses only the more passionate. Empty and unlimited, she seeks from within her <i>nothingness</i> to attain <i><b>All</b></i>.”
					― Simone de Beauvoir, <i>The Second Sex</i></p>

					"Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by
					fictional characters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or
					powers. The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world,
					complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created

					to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed
					via standard telnet clients, or specialized MUD clients, which are designed to improve the
					userexperience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector."
