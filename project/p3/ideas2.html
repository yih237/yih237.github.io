              >The context of the work is basically a collection of drinks. I believe the collector’s intent is to focus
              on colorful and fun drinks, because most of the drinks in the collection are in bright colors and have
              cool design elements. <br /></span

              Is there background / surroundings? Are they cropped, masked, clipped? <br /></span

            ><span class="text"
              >The images are created by shooting in a studio and cropping out the backgorund, replacing the background
              with white, and some may be created digitally. </span
            ><span class="span14"
              >I have a problam, though, qwith this collection because I believe that the collector has not spent effort
              in the consistency of style, it consists of all kinds of drinks in all styles. The color, the packaging,
              the genre of the drink, etc. vary a lot. Well, ok, maybe they were not lazy like I thought, maybe they
              meant for it to be that way, but they also did not spend a little bit of time to the backgrounds
              transparent, and gave put work on my plate. Camille’s collection of computers, for example, cropped out
              all excess background. I believe that finding images of drinks is already super super easy compaired to
              many of our classmates’ work, so I believe that my partner should take on the responsibility into making a
              more focused, more consistent collection. <br /></span
