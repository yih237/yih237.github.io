      I end where I began: reading—learning to read and reading books, the words a form of food, a form of life, and then knowledge. But also my mother. I don’t know exactly how old I was when she taught me to read, but I can say for certain that by the time I was three and a half I could read properly.

    <div class="dropdown-content">This reading of mine so interfered with her own time to read that she
        enrolled me in school; but you could be enrolled in school only if you
        were five years old, and so she told me to remember to say, if asked, that
        I was five. My first performance as a writer of fiction? No, not that at
        all. Perhaps this: the first time I was asked who I was. And who am I? In
        an ideal world, a world in which the Tree of Life and the Tree of
        Knowledge stand before me, before all of us, we ask, Who am I? Among the
        many of us not given a chance to answer is the woman in the library in St.
        John’s, Antigua, two large rooms above the Treasury Department, a building
        that was steps away from the customs office and the wharf where things
        coming and going lay. On that wharf worked a stevedore who loaded onto
        ships bags of raw sugar en route to England, to be refined into white
        sugar, which was so expensive that we, in my family, had it only on
        Sundays, as a special treat. I did not know of the stevedore, the lover of
        this woman who would not allow her children to have much white sugar
        because, somewhere in the world of Dr. Pasteur and his cohort, they had
        come to all sorts of conclusions about diseases and their relationships to
        food (beriberi was a disease my mother succeeded in saving me from
        suffering). Her name was Annie Victoria Richardson Drew, and she was born
        in a village in Dominica, British West Indies. ♦</div>
