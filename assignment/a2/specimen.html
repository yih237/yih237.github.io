    <div class="title">Acumin Pro</div>
    <p class="intro">Acumin is a versatile sans-serif typeface family designed by Robert Slimbach, intended for a
      balanced and rational quality. Solidly neo-grotesque, it performs beautifully at display sizes but also maintains
      an exceptional degree of sensitivity for text sizes.</p>
    <div class="history">
      <p>
        Acumin developed from a simple idea and turned into a complex type
        family. At first, the design brief was for a single family of regular
        and bold, with matching italics, that could be used primarily in forms
        and in online documents – the very places that Helvetica, Univers, and
        their descendants and imitators are so often used. But it quickly
        became clear that more was needed: a more complete suite of typefaces
        and typographic voices, suitable for a very wide range of uses,
        including continuous text. A system, in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Robert Slimbach saw the movie
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847817/"><cite>Helvetica</cite></a>
        , his thought was: <em>but it’s all signage!</em> There was no talk
        about text. He reflected that Helvetica had always been a display
        typeface, never really designed for text, but that it had become so
        popular that it got forced into the mold of a text typeface and used
        that way constantly. It could be very appealing for that use, with its
        even appearance, but its design parameters and letterfit didn’t really
        suit text.
      <p>
        As a type designer, Slimbach has always focused on text – and on the
        calligraphic roots of type. As he thought about a new neo-grotesque,
        his first impetus was to reinvent the category, to make it “much more
        human.” But he realized that “human” really wasn’t what neo-grotesques
        were about; the defining features of neo-grotesques are their
        neutrality and their architectural structure. So he had to severely
        restrain his urge to soften or personalize the design too much. Still,
        he managed to introduce warmth and humanity into it in a very subtle
        way. And he resolved to push the boundaries of the category wherever
        possible.
