                The only book available to me, a book I was allowed to read all by
                myself without anyone paying attention to me, was the King James
                Version of the Bible. There’s no need for me to go into the troubles
                with the
                <span class="blink">King James Version of the Bible</span> here, but
                when I encountered the first book, the Book of Genesis, I immediately
                understood it to be a book for children. A person, I came to
                understand much later, exists in the kingdom of children no matter how
                old the person is; even Methuselah, I came to see, was a child. But
                never mind that, it was the creation story that was so compelling to
                me, especially the constant refrain
                <span class="blink">“And God saw that it was good.”</span> The God in
                the Book of Genesis made things, and at the end of each day he saw
                that they were good. But, I wondered, for something to be good would
                there not have to be something that was not good, or not as good? That
                was a problem, though I didn’t bother myself with it at the time,
                mainly because I didn’t know how to, and also because the story had an
                inexorableness to it: rolling on from one thing to another without a
                pause until, by the end of six days, there were a man and a woman made
                in God’s image, there were fish in the sea and animals creeping on
                land and birds flying in the air and plants growing, and God found it
                all good, because here we are.

            It was in the week after this creation, on the eighth day, that the
            trouble began: loneliness set in. And so God made a garden, dividing it
            into four quarters by running water through it <span class="blink">(the classic quadrilinear
                style that is still a standard in garden design)</span> and placing borders,
            the borders being the eternal good and evil: the Tree of Life and the
            Tree of Knowledge. One tree was to be partaken of, the other forbidden.
            I have since come to see that in the garden itself, throughout human
            association with it, the Edenic plan works in the same way: the Tree of
            Life is agriculture and the Tree of <span class="blink">Knowledge</span> is horticulture. We
            cultivate food, and when there is a surplus of it, producing wealth, we
            cultivate the spaces of contemplation, a garden of plants not necessary
            for physical survival. The awareness of that fact is what gives the
            garden its special, powerful place in our lives and our imaginations.
            The Tree of Knowledge holds unknown, and therefore dangerous
            possibilities; the Tree of Life is eternally necessary, and the Tree of
            Knowledge is deeply and divinely dependent on it. This is not a new
            thought for me. I could see it in my mother’s relationship to the things
            she grew, the kind of godlike domination she would display over them.
            She, I remember, didn’t make such fine distinctions, she only moved the
            plants around when they pleased her and destroyed them when they fell
            out of favor.

            It is no surprise to me that my affection for the garden, including its
            most disturbing attributes, its most violent implications and
            associations, is intertwined with my mother. As a child, I did not know
            myself or the world I inhabited without her. She is the person who gave
            me and taught me the Word.

            But where is the garden and where am I in it? This memory of growing
            things, anything, outside not inside, remained in my memory—or whatever
            we call that haunting, invisible wisp that is steadily part of our
            being—and wherever I lived in my young years, in New York City in
            particular, I planted: marigolds, portulaca, herbs for cooking,
            petunias, and other things that were familiar to me, all reminding me of
            my mother, the place I came from. <span class="blink">Those first plants were in pots and
                lived on the roof of a diner that served only breakfast and lunch, in a
                dilapidated building at 284 Hudson Street, whose ownership was
                uncertain, which is the fate of us all.</span> Ownership of ourselves and of
            the ground on which we walk, ownership of the other beings with whom we
            share this and see that it is good, and ownership of the vegetable
            kingdom are all uncertain, too. <span class="blink">Nevertheless, in the garden, we perform
                the act of possessing.</span> To name is to possess; possessing is the original
            violation bequeathed to Adam and his equal companion in creation, Eve,
            by their creator. It is their transgression in disregarding his command
            that leads him not only to cast them into the wilderness, the unknown,
            but also to cast out the other possession that he designed with great
            clarity and determination and purpose: the garden! For me, the story of
            the garden in Genesis is a way of understanding my garden obsession.
            <br /><br />
            The appearance of the garden in our everyday life is so accepted that we
            embrace its presence as therapeutic. Some people say that weeding is a
            form of comfort and of settling into misery or happiness. The garden
            makes managing an excess of feelings—good feelings, bad
            feelings—rewarding in some way that <span class="blink"></span>I can never quite understand. The
            garden is a heap of disturbance, and it may be that my particular
            history, the history I share with millions of people, begins with our
            ancestors’ violent removal from an Eden. The regions of Africa from
            which they came would have been Eden-like, and the horror that met them
            in that “New World” could certainly be seen as the Fall. Your home, the
            place you are from, is always Eden, the place where even imperfections
            were perfect, and everything that happened after that beginning
            interrupted your Paradise.
